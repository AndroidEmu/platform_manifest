Genymotion Open Source Project
=================

Genymotion (formerly known as AndroVM) is a port of AOSP on x86 architecture.

Our goal is to give Android developpers a new way to developp and test their applications.

Using those manifests, you'll be able to build the latest version Genymotion:
 * genymotion-2.3.7_r1
 * genymotion-4.1.1_r6.1
 * genymotion-4.2.2_r1.2
 * genymotion-4.3_r3.1
 * genymotion-2.4.2_r1

Pre-compiled version of Genymotion, tools, and many more things can be download directly on our website: www.genymotion.com
